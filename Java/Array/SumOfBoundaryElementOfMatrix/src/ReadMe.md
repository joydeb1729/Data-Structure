# Sum of Boundary Elements - Java Implementation

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to calculate the sum of boundary elements in a 2D matrix using object-oriented programming principles in Java. The logic for the boundary sum calculation is encapsulated in the `SumOfBoundary` class, and the `Main` class serves as the entry point for executing the program.

## Structure

- **`SumOfBoundary` Class**: 
  - Contains the logic to sum the boundary elements of the matrix.
  - **Constructor**: Accepts a 2D matrix (array).
  - **Method**: `calculateSumOfBoundary()` - Iterates through the matrix and calculates the sum of boundary elements.

- **`Main` Class**: 
  - Manages the execution of the program.
  - Initializes the matrix and uses an instance of `SumOfBoundary` to calculate and display the boundary sum.

## How to Run

1. Clone or download the project.
2. Compile the Java files:
   ```bash
   javac Main.java SumOfBoundary.java
