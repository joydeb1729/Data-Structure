# Sum of Boundary Elements - Python Implementation

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to calculate the sum of boundary elements in a 2D matrix using object-oriented programming principles in Python. The boundary sum calculation logic is encapsulated in the `SumOfBoundary` class, and the program execution is handled by the `Main` class.

## Structure

- **`SumOfBoundary` Class**: 
  - Contains the logic to sum the boundary elements of the matrix.
  - **`__init__` Method**: Accepts a 2D matrix (list of lists).
  - **`calculate_sum_of_boundary` Method**: Iterates through the matrix and calculates the sum of boundary elements.

- **`Main` Class**: 
  - Manages the execution of the program.
  - Initializes the matrix and uses an instance of `SumOfBoundary` to calculate and display the boundary sum.

## How to Run

1. Clone or download the project.
2. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
